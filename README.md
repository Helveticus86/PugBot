#PugBot

PugBot is an open source Discord bot (built off of the amazing work of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)) that gives you a quick glance at a World of Warcraft character. Use it to get a quick summary of any character (like Pugs!).

## Add To Your Server
I (Reznok) am not currently hosting PugBot. Please either self host it, or find someone who is hosting it.  
If you are hosting PugBot, submit a PR with your Bot invite link, and I'll add him here!

## Configuration
If you want to download PugBot and host him yourself, you will need the following:

+ A Discord Bot Token ([Click Here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/))
+ A WoW API Key ([dev.battle.net](https://dev.battle.net))

Add the token and api key to config.json and run pugbot.py
